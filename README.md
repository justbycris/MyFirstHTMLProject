# MyFirstHTMLProject
This is my first HTML project. I am working on this project as I go with my learning on Javascript. 
The resources I am using to learn is freecodecamp.org, google, vs code, and I am reading blogs about tips on learning how to code 
by already successful self-taught software developers.

    <p>My name is Cristina Gutierrez and today is May 17, 2020 at 9:53am. I'm sitting in my Brooklyn apartment, on day two of my journey on becoming a software developer. The reason why I decided to learn is because right now we are living a world history
        crisis: COVID-19. Therefore, 12 days ago I lost my job and the opportunity to renew my international visa to stay in NY. Which means that despite me being confident in my ability to get a job and consider myself a talendted Graphic Designer, there
        is one thing I can't control and that is the economic crisis and unemployment rates. The last job I was working at was a tech non-profit who's mission was to connect talent with opportunity by teaching low income background people how to become
        softwared developers and land a job in tech. I was there 6 months as an intern and some people mentioned that I should learned how to code as well. I would just let the idea pass over my head since I thought I had a job already and why should
        I learned something to change my career comepletely? but now that there is over 25 million citizens in this country without a job, I have realized that everyone I know who has one and very well pay one is a software developer of some type. Can
        you imagine how nice? <br> Therefore, I have decided that if I never want to go through the same stressful situation ever again, I should invest in myself and learn how to code to secure a better future. </p>

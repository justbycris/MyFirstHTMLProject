            <p style="color: #1e1e1e" style="text-align: center;"> Hey! I'm Cristi. I was born and raised in Veracruz, Mexico. When I was 17, I came to the U.S. to study in a Golf Academy for my senior year of High School. By the end of my senior year, I was offered the opportunity to represent Lynn University's
                Golf Team with a sports scholarship. There I completed my undergraduate college career with a B.A. in Digital Arts & Design. After graduation, I pursued my dream of living in New York City with my twin brother. There I had the opportunity
                to work as a Content & Design intern in a tech non-profit that teached adults how to code. During the 6 months of my internship, I met so many great people who changed thier lives by learning how to code. <br> My internship ended because
                of the COVID-19 pandemic and the economic crisis it brought with it. I saw my career and dream of living in NYC being turned apart because of the unexpected situation. So I promised myself that I would learn the necessary skills that will
                help me prepare for the uncertain situations that the future holds. Those skills came in learning how to code. </p>
